The camera had belonged to her grandmother, one of those heavy Soviet-era things that felt like holding a small engine. A Zenit-E, the body scratched and worn smooth in places where hands had gripped it for decades. It shouldn't have worked anymore.

Dani found it in the back of a closet she'd been avoiding for three months, buried under quilts that still smelled like lavender and wool and something else—something that was just *Baba*, a scent she couldn't name and would never encounter again.

She almost threw it away.

---

The first photograph she took was an accident.

She'd loaded the camera with film from the drugstore, the cheap kind that came in yellow boxes, just to see if the shutter still fired. It did—a satisfying mechanical *chunk* that felt like a small door closing.

She pointed it at the kitchen window. The light was doing something interesting, the way late afternoon light does in October, and she thought: *why not*.

When the prints came back from the one-hour photo place (the last one in town, run by a man who looked at her like she'd arrived from 1987), the kitchen window was there.

So was her grandmother.

Not a ghost, not a blur, not a trick of light. Baba, clear as anything, standing at the sink where she'd stood ten thousand times, washing dishes that weren't there, looking out at a garden that had died the same week she did.

---

Dani didn't sleep that night.

She told herself it was a double exposure. She told herself it was a prank, though she couldn't imagine who would prank her this way, or how. She told herself she was seeing what she wanted to see, the way people find faces in clouds and toast and the surface of the moon.

In the morning, she loaded more film.

---

*The second photograph was not an accident.*

She took it in her grandmother's bedroom, the one she still couldn't bring herself to empty. The bed was made—Dani had made it, the day after the funeral, because it felt wrong to leave it unmade and wrong to change the sheets.

In the photograph, someone was sleeping in it.

The shape under the quilts was soft, indistinct, but undeniably human. Undeniably present.

Dani sat on the floor of the one-hour photo place and cried until the man behind the counter brought her a cup of water and a box of tissues and didn't ask any questions.

## What the Camera Saw

Over the next month, Dani took forty-seven photographs.

The camera showed her:

Her grandfather, dead since 1998, reading a newspaper at the kitchen table. The headline was in Russian. She couldn't read it, but she recognized the masthead: *Pravda*, the same paper he'd read every morning before he learned to love the *New York Times*.

Her mother at sixteen, sitting on the porch steps, smoking a cigarette. Her mother had quit in 1985, the year Dani was born. She'd never seen her mother smoke anything.

A woman she didn't recognize, standing in the garden, holding a baby. The woman wore clothes from another century. The baby was wrapped in the same quilt that now sat at the bottom of the closet, worn thin and soft as skin.

A dog she'd never met, curled up on the couch, dreaming dog dreams.

Her grandmother, again and again and again. Cooking. Sewing. Reading. Praying. Living the thousand ordinary moments that make up a life, frozen now on drugstore film, visible only through a Soviet lens.

Dani stopped showing the photographs to anyone.

She stopped trying to explain.

She just kept shooting.

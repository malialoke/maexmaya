Maya found the first note tucked inside a library book about constellations. The handwriting was cramped, urgent, the kind of script that suggested secrets kept too long. *If you're reading this, you already know something is wrong.*

She didn't know anything was wrong. She was fifteen and bored and the summer stretched ahead of her like a sentence she didn't know how to finish.

## Part One

The library was the only place in town with reliable air conditioning, which meant it was the only place worth being between June and September. Maya had staked out her territory in the astronomy section three summers ago, back when she still believed she might become the kind of person who understood the universe.

Now she just liked the quiet.

The book was called *Mapping the Night Sky: A Beginner's Guide*, and she'd checked it out six times without ever reading past chapter two. Something about the photographs—all those pinprick lights against infinite black—made her feel both very small and very possible.

The note fell out when she opened to the chapter on Cassiopeia.

*She read it three times before the words arranged themselves into meaning.*

The handwriting belonged to someone who had learned cursive and then abandoned it, loops collapsing into sharp angles mid-word. The paper was torn from a yellow legal pad, the kind her mother used for grocery lists and arguments she was preparing to have.

> If you're reading this, you already know something is wrong. Meet me at the water tower. Thursday. 2 AM. Tell no one.
> 
> — V

Maya did not know anyone whose name started with V.

She also did not know what was wrong, or why someone would hide a note in a library book, or why that someone would assume the reader would come to a water tower in the middle of the night based on six sentences and a single initial.

But she knew she was going to go.

## Part Two

Thursday arrived the way summer days do—slowly, then all at once, the light stretching long across her bedroom floor until it finally gave up and let the dark in.

Her parents were asleep by eleven. They'd been asleep by eleven every night since her father's diagnosis, exhaustion settling over the house like a weather pattern no one acknowledged.

Maya waited until midnight, then one, then one-thirty. She put on dark clothes. She told herself this was an adventure, the kind of thing that happened in books, the kind of thing that never happened to her.

The water tower was a twenty-minute walk through backyards and empty lots. She'd passed it a thousand times without really seeing it—just another piece of infrastructure, rusting quietly at the edge of town.

Tonight it looked different. Tonight it looked like a question.

Every story I've ever finished started as something I was sure I couldn't write.

Not in the romantic, tortured-artist way. In the practical way—the "I don't know enough about this topic" way, the "this has been done better by people who actually know what they're doing" way. The voice in my head that sounds reasonable, that frames giving up as wisdom.

I've learned to write anyway.

This site is a start. A place to put the words, to make them real by making them public. I've been writing fiction for years, but I've been writing it *privately*—safe in the knowledge that no one would read it, which meant no one could tell me it was bad.

That's its own kind of trap.

So here we are. Stories, every other week. Some will be good. Some will be learning in public. All of them will be finished, which is more than I could say about the drafts folder on my laptop.

If you're reading this, thank you. Not for your attention—attention is cheap—but for the possibility that something I wrote might matter to you. That's the whole point, isn't it? The connection between the person who writes and the person who reads?

Let's see what happens.

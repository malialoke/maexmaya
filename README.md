# maexmaya

This site is built with Astro and Tailwind—tools that let me make something that actually looks and feels like mine instead of another cookie-cutter template with the same hamburger menu and interchangeable sections as every other website on the internet.

I miss when having a website meant spending hours making something weird and personal in Paint Shop Pro, hand-coding the HTML, and putting it out there for whoever wandered by. I built this because I refuse to participate in platforms that amplify fascists and nazis, and I'd rather bypass traditional publishing entirely than be required to post on X or Instagram in the name of marketing and building a brand. I write what I want to write, and I say what I want to say, where I want to say it.

Fascists, racists, transphobes, and billionaires aren't welcome here.

The stories on this site are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA—you're free to remix, adapt, or create transformative works as long as you credit me, link back, don't profit without permission, and share your work under the same terms.

## privacy

Most websites have privacy policies because they need to disclose all the ways they're tracking you. This one exists to tell you I'm not. I built this site without analytics, cookies, or tracking pixels, which means I have no idea how many people visit, what they read, or how long they stay. The internet wasn't supposed to be a surveillance machine, and I wanted to make something that works the way websites used to—you show up, you read what you want, and you leave without a trace. If you want me to know you were here, you'll have to tell me yourself. Find me as maexmaya on Bluesky or support the work on Patreon. Otherwise, enjoy the anonymity.
